# Goals

- [x] Fill the data in .credit-card-box, took from the ViewState
- [x] When the #card-ccv field is focused, add class .hover to .credit-card-box (remove it on blur)
- [x] Focus the next input when it's filled (if val.length > 3 then next.focus)
- [x] Make sure one can only type numbers
- [x] Make the submit button actually working, i.e. save the data somewhere remotely
